Problem Statement
In the traditional property market—whether for land, houses, or vehicles—selling agents operate without a secure, standardized system to guarantee their commission. The current process relies on verbal agreements and informal contracts, leaving agents vulnerable to fraud. Following a successful sale, property owners can, and often do, bypass the agent, denying them their rightful payment. This lack of accountability creates a high-risk environment that undermines trust and discourages professional agents, stifling a vital part of the economy.

Solution: A Professional Platform for Fair Commission Payments
We propose a hybrid Web2 and Web3 platform designed to secure and automate commission payments for selling agents. Our solution creates a transparent, binding, and self-executing agreement between the property owner and the agent, ensuring that commission is paid automatically upon the successful completion of a sale.

Web2 User Experience: The platform will feature a user-friendly Web2 interface that allows agents and owners to create accounts, list properties, and manage their deals in a familiar, accessible environment. This ensures a smooth onboarding process and broad adoption.

Web3 Trust Layer: At the core of every transaction is a smart contract on a blockchain. Once a property owner and agent agree on a commission rate, the owner pre-funds the smart contract with the commission amount. This digital escrow is tamper-proof and automatically executes the payment once both parties digitally confirm the sale. This eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary and removes the risk of non-payment.

Our system creates a new standard for trust and accountability in the agent-based sales industry.

Target Audience
Local (Initial Focus)
Our initial target audience is independent, small-to-mid-sized selling agents and individual property owners in a specific city or region. These are the agents most susceptible to non-payment, as they often lack the resources or legal teams of larger firms to enforce their contracts. We will focus on a market with a high volume of agent-driven sales but a low level of digital platform adoption.

International (Future Scaling)
After establishing a strong local presence and proving the model's effectiveness, we will expand our target audience. The core technology, being blockchain-based, is inherently borderless. We will scale by:

Geographic Expansion: Targeting other countries with similar market dynamics where agents are at risk and the real estate industry is ripe for disruption.

Sector Diversification: Applying the same model to other high-value, commission-based sales markets, such as vehicles, machinery, and luxury goods.

Enterprise Partnerships: Collaborating with large real estate agencies and firms to integrate our solution as their official payment and contract management system, offering a more secure alternative to their current processes.
